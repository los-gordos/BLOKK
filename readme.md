BLOKK font is the perfect example of the power that lies in everyday creativity – and how even the smallest of ideas can have the greatest potential.

We often say that ideas aren’t worth anything anymore – anyone can have ideas. The problem is not having them, but realizing their potential. Pushing through and turning one of those ideas into something real and touchable.

The BLOKK font is one of those ideas, being born from an own need for a smart tool for the right kind of job, BLOKK font is not a font for everything, it’s a font especially designed for mock-ups, wireframing and prototyping.

BLOKK font didn’t end up as just an idea, thats my point. It’s a small and brilliant insight, and the people behind it didn’t end with just that, they designed, it, built it and spread it. And today, we could safely say, that all over the world thousands upon thousands of people have installed BLOKK font on their computers and hopefully even used it in products and pitches.

How do we know it’s a good idea? If it wasn’t for the downloads and the references from hundreds of online sources, some great feedback and some really poor. But the true assurance that it as been a success is when someone else gets inspired, redesignes it, improves it, and publish a font truly superior to ours. Inspired by the idea and the production that we initially made.

BLOKK font is proof that the Internet works for brilliant ideas and that it makes good ideas even better.
